### Java Variables

In Java, variables are containers for storing data values. They have a specific data type, such as int, float, double, or String, which determines the kind of data they can hold.

#### Declaration and Initialization

```java
// Declaration
int age;

// Initialization
age = 25;

// Declaration and Initialization in one line
int height = 180;
```

#### Data Types

- **Primitive Data Types:**
  - `byte`: 8-bit signed integer
  - `short`: 16-bit signed integer
  - `int`: 32-bit signed integer
  - `long`: 64-bit signed integer
  - `float`: 32-bit floating-point
  - `double`: 64-bit floating-point
  - `char`: 16-bit Unicode character
  - `boolean`: Represents true or false

- **Reference Data Types:**
  - `String`: Represents a sequence of characters

#### Variable Naming

- Variable names are case-sensitive.
- Should begin with a letter, dollar sign `$`, or underscore `_`.
- Subsequent characters can be letters, digits, dollar signs, or underscores.

#### Constants

```java
final double PI = 3.14;
```

### Exercises:

1. Declare an integer variable named `num` and initialize it with the value 42.

2. Create a double variable named `price` and assign it the value 19.99.

3. Define a String variable `name` with your name as its value.

4. Calculate the area of a rectangle using variables `length` and `width`.

5. Convert Fahrenheit to Celsius using the formula `Celsius = (Fahrenheit - 32) * 5/9`.
